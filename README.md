# AsteroidNeo


Before running the project, please take the steps listed below; else, compile time errors will occur.

1. As I did use xcode14, kindly ensure that the xcode IDE is version 14 or later to run the project.
2. To successfully run the project without encountering any build errors, run the "pod install" command in the downloaded project's terminal after downloading it from Github.
